# Surql-Gen Project Status & Documentation Router

This document serves as a central hub for tracking the status of the surql-gen
project and navigating the documentation.

## Project Overview

Surql-gen is a tool for generating type-safe schemas from SurrealQL definitions,
with support for automatic query type inference. We're in the process of
migrating from TypeBox to Effect Schema for better type safety and more advanced
features.

### Key Features

1. **Schema Generation**: Create type-safe schemas from SurrealQL definitions
   - TypeBox schemas (legacy)
   - Effect Schema (recommended)
2. **Query Type Inference**: Automatically infer TypeScript types from SurrealQL
   queries
3. **Type-Safe API**: Build a type-safe interface for working with SurrealDB

## Current Phase: Core Functionality & Query Type Inference

We have completed several key milestones:

1. âœ… Initial implementation of the Effect Schema system
2. âœ… Array type handling and validation
3. âœ… Basic test coverage for schema generation
4. âœ… Basic query type inference

Current focus areas:

1. Enhancing the query parser to handle more complex queries
2. Improving test coverage
3. Resolving remaining linting issues
4. Documenting the implemented features

## How to Work with This Project

For detailed information on working with the surql-gen project, please refer to
the [How to Work guide](./docs/HOW_TO_WORK.md). The guide covers:

- Development environment setup
- Project structure
- Development workflow
- Code style and standards
- Testing procedures
- Common tasks and troubleshooting

### Quick Start for Contributors

1. Set up your environment following the [HOW_TO_WORK.md](./docs/HOW_TO_WORK.md)
   guide
2. Choose a task from [TODO.md](./docs/TODO.md)
3. Familiarize yourself with the relevant technical documentation
4. Implement your changes following project standards
5. Add tests and update documentation
6. Submit a pull request

## Known Issues

1. NPM package dependencies are not automatically installed. Need to set up
   `nodeModulesDir` in `deno.json`.
2. The query parser doesn't currently handle complex JOINs properly.
3. Some linting issues remain in prototype implementations.
4. Array type handling needs more comprehensive testing with different
   scenarios.
