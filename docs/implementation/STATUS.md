# Effect Schema Migration - Implementation Status

## What's Been Implemented

### Core Infrastructure

- [x] Added Effect Schema dependencies to deno.json
- [x] Updated configuration system to support selecting Effect Schema via a
      `schemaSystem` option
- [x] Created TypeBox to Effect Schema mapping reference document
- [x] Updated import generation to handle Effect Schema imports

### Schema Generation

- [x] Implemented prototype for Effect Schema generation in
      `lib/effect-schema.ts`
  - Basic type conversion from SurrealDB types to Effect Schema
  - Support for branded types for RecordId
  - Code generation for Effect Schema schemas
- [x] Updated commands.ts to use the appropriate schema generator based on
      configuration

### Query Type Inference

- [x] Created prototype of SurrealQL query parser in `lib/query-parser.ts`
  - Basic support for parsing SELECT queries
  - Field extraction including nested fields with wildcards
  - Support for query modifiers like LIMIT
- [x] Implemented SchemaRegistry for storing and retrieving table schemas
- [x] Added type inference for query results based on parsed query and schema
      registry
- [x] Created example to demonstrate the query parser and type inference

## Current Limitations

1. The Effect Schema generator is still a prototype and needs refinement
2. The query parser is basic and doesn't handle complex queries well
3. No test suite exists yet for the Effect Schema implementation
4. The query type inference doesn't support all SurrealQL features

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. Fix linting issues in existing prototype code
2. Refine the Effect Schema type generation
   - Improve handling of constraints
   - Add support for more advanced types
3. Enhance the SurrealQL query parser
   - Support for JOINs
   - Better handling of complex WHERE conditions
   - Support for other query types (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### Medium-Term Goals

1. Create a comprehensive test suite for both schema generation and query
   parsing
2. Implement a fluent query builder API with type inference
3. Add integration with SurrealDB client for type-safe query execution
4. Create more examples showing different use cases

### Long-Term Vision

1. Provide a complete type-safe querying experience for SurrealDB
2. Support schema evolution and migration
3. Implement IDE plugins for query validation and autocompletion
4. Create a community of extensions and plugins

## Open Issues and Questions

1. How to handle schema validation at runtime?
2. What's the best approach for query builder API design?
3. How to handle potentially dynamic queries?
4. How to optimize performance for large schemas?

## Documentation Plan

1. Update README.md with information about Effect Schema support
2. Create a migration guide for users transitioning from TypeBox to Effect
   Schema
3. Document the query type inference capabilities
4. Create a reference for the query builder API
