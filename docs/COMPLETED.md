- [x] Publish as CLI tool
  - [x] Publish to JSR (replaces deno.land/x)

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- [x] DB connection schema generation creates `db.ts` file instead of using the
      configured filename `schema.ts`
- [x] The schema generated by DB connection and file processing have different
      type structures
- [x] References fields are not properly typed in DB connection output
- [x] Check how the DB connection mode determines the output file path
- [x] Verify if there's a hardcoded output path when using direct DB connection
      vs .surql file
- [x] Compare file paths used in both file processing and DB processing
- [x] Add clear documentation for both file and DB generation paths
- [x] Fix the `processDB` function to exclusively use the configured output path
- [x] DB connection doesn't handle `references<table>` fields correctly,
      misinterpreting them as strings
- [x] Updated `parseFieldDefinition` function to properly recognize and handle
      references types
- [x] Added specific handling for references in field object processing

## Schema Export Format Consistency

- [x] Schema exports have different formats between SurrealDB's export and our
      schema.overwrite.surql
- [x] Key differences include:
  - [x] Our exports add `OVERWRITE` keyword to all definitions when using the
        overwrite option
  - [x] Need to ensure both formats can be properly parsed and type-generated
- [x] Create tests to ensure schema parsing works with both export formats
- [x] Verify type generation consistency between different schema formats
- [x] Enhance `exportSchemaFromDB` function to preserve original database schema
      format
- [x] Create a schema converter script to convert between different schema
      formats
- [x] Simplify the export-schema command to preserve the database's original
      schema settings
- [x] Create fixture files with different schema formats for testing
- [x] Add test cases to schema_export_test.ts for handling different table types
- [x] Test schema application to database with different formats
- [x] Add test for TYPE ANY SCHEMALESS with OVERWRITE to verify compatibility
- [x] Discovered that SurrealDB databases can have different table types and
      schema modes
- [x] Simplified export-schema functionality to preserve the original schema
      structure from the database
- [x] All schema formats produce the same type definitions despite their
      differences
- [x] Removed unnecessary options that tried to force specific table types and
      schema modes

## Effect Schema Migration (Phase 1)

- [x] Install Effect dependencies
  - [x] Add Effect Schema dependencies to deno.json
  - [x] Create necessary Effect-specific configurations
- [x] Analyze current TypeBox implementation
  - [x] Document all TypeBox type builders currently in use
  - [x] Map TypeBox functions to corresponding Effect Schema functions
  - [x] Identify any custom type definitions that need special handling
- [x] Create a sample conversion in a test file
  - [x] Convert a simple table schema using Effect Schema
  - [x] Ensure type generation and validation works as expected
- [x] Update schema.ts to support Effect Schema
  - [x] Create a new function `generateEffectSchemas` alongside the existing
        `generateTypeBoxSchemas`
  - [x] Implement mapping functions to convert SurrealDB types to Effect Schema
        types
  - [x] Add support for Effect Schema's transformation capabilities
- [x] Update config.ts
  - [x] Add option to select schema system (TypeBox or Effect)
  - [x] Update import path handling for Effect Schema
- [x] Update commands.ts
  - [x] Add support for generating Effect Schema in CLI commands
  - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with TypeBox

## Query Type Inference (Phase 1)

- [x] Implement SurrealQL parser for inferring types from queries
  - [x] Create a new module for SurrealQL parsing with focus on SELECT
        statements
  - [x] Design a grammar to extract table names and field selections from
        queries
- [x] Implement type inferring system
  - [x] Generate Effect Schema types based on query selections
  - [x] Handle field projections and table joins
  - [x] Support proper typing for `select *` vs specific field selection
- [x] Create helper functions
  - [x] Implement utility to parse and validate SurrealQL queries
  - [x] Add function to infer return type from query string
